# Timer Application
## How to Download?
In the Github release tab of this repositorary, there is a .zip folder to download. Simply extract the zip folder then run the Timer.jar file. 
In order for the timer to run, the .dat files must be in the same directory. All files are included in the zip folder.

## Where can I find the code? Why is the repo structured like this?
This project was a part of one of my college courses. Therefore, the repo is divided by the course's modules. 
The timer application's code can be found in the module7 directory.
